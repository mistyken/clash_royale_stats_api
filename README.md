# clash_royale_stats_api

A simple clash royale statistic collector/aggregator with serverless, AWS Lambda and Dynamodb

The idea is to creata an application to gather ladder game statistic such as win rate, opponent king level, previous and highest trophy count, the type of deck etc

A player could refer to these statistic to see if their game is generally improving
